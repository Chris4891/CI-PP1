# About us
We are a small family company that has been breeding different types of dogs for many years, exclusively out of love for them. For all those who are not 100% sure that they would like to become dog owners, we offer them an experience. They can rent a dog from us for a certain period of time. Feed, sit, play, and pet him. Experience what it's like to have a dog, as well as other obligations, but also the pleasure and joy that come with them, such as feeding, sitting, playing, and petting. We rent our dogs to verified people with a mandatory contract. For more information, contact us with confidence.



## Services
 * Assist you in having a new and exciting experience by socializing and living with a dog, going out with the dog, and learning more about its life.
 * Know more about you and recommend the ideal dog for you.
 * You don't have to buy a dog to do all of that; you may rent one for a month or two, as many as you like, and then buy one if you enjoy your new friend.
