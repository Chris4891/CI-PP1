# About us
We are a small family company that has been breeding different types of dogs for many years, exclusively out of love for them. For all those who are not 100% sure that they would like to become dog owners, we offer them an experience. They can rent a dog from us for a certain period of time. Feed, sit, play, and pet him. Experience what it's like to have a dog, as well as other obligations, but also the pleasure and joy that come with them, such as feeding, sitting, playing, and petting. We rent our dogs to verified people with a mandatory contract. For more information, contact us with confidence.



## Services
 * Assist you in having a new and exciting experience by socializing and living with a dog, going out with the dog, and learning more about its life.
 * Know more about you and recommend the ideal dog for you.
 * You don't have to buy a dog to do all of that; you may rent one for a month or two, as many as you like, and then buy one if you enjoy your new friend.

### Strategy
Our objective is to make the design as simple and user-friendly as possible so that users can access our services without difficulty.

### Scope
We assist website clients in enjoying a new and exciting experience by socialising and living with a dog, going on walks with the dog, and learning more about its life.

### Structure
The site is designed to help you get the information you need as fast as possible. Contact information is easily accessible on the navigation bar, and it contains all of the information needed to contact us.
To make it easier to navigate, a navigation bar has a major services button. It is also mobile responsive, therefore there will be a humburger menu in the mobile to make it easier to access. The entire website is responsive and works with all browsers.

### Navbar hamburger icon <img width='15px' src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109537705/192861448-dc0bdae8-42e3-4649-9aa8-7a00290bf197.png' />

When the hamburger icon in the navigation bar, which shows on smaller screens, such as those used by mobile and tablet users, is tapped, it opens the navbar menu items, allowing users to move between website features. When clicked again, the navbar menu items are closed and the hamburger icon is returned.

### Skeleton
The following wireframes were built using Figma:
